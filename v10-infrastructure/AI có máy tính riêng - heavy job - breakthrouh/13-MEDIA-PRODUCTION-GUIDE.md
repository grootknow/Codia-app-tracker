```yaml
Track (First 48 hours):
  Metrics:
    - Views (velocity matters)
    - CTR (click-through rate on thumbnail/title)
    - AVD (average view duration) - aim >50%
    - Engagement (likes, comments, shares)
    - Traffic sources (where views coming from)
  
  Tools:
    - YouTube Studio (real-time)
    - TubeBuddy (competitor benchmarking)
    - Custom dashboard in tracker app

Analyze (Week 1):
  Questions:
    - What's working? (high retention parts)
    - Where dropoff? (edit tighter next time)
    - Which thumbnail won A/B test?
    - Best traffic source?
    - Subscriber conversion rate?
  
  Actions:
    - Comment responses (engagement algo boost)
    - Pin top comment (context or CTA)
    - Update description if needed
    - Promote on other platforms

Calculate ROI:
  Formula:
    Production Cost = Equipment depreciation + Software + Time + Outsource
    Revenue = Ad revenue + Sponsorships + Affiliate
    ROI% = ((Revenue - Cost) / Cost) × 100
  
  Track in Database:
    - content_production_costs table
    - content_revenue table
    - Calculate per video, per month, per channel

Iterate (Month 1+):
  What to optimize:
    - Topics (double down on high performers)
    - Thumbnails (test variants)
    - Titles (SEO + curiosity)
    - Intro hook (first 30 seconds critical)
    - CTA placement (when to ask subscribe)
    - Publishing schedule (consistency > perfection)
  
  Goals:
    - Month 1: Publish 8 videos (2x/week)
    - Month 3: 100 subscribers
    - Month 6: 1,000 subscribers (monetization)
    - Month 12: 10,000 subscribers
    - Revenue target: $500/mo @ 1K subs, $5K/mo @ 100K subs
```

```

### **Auto-Tiering Workflow**

```yaml
Automated:
  1. NAS → R2 (every 4 hours via Kopia)
     Trigger: New files >4 hours old
     Method: Incremental backup
     
  2. R2 → Google Drive (daily at 3am)
     Trigger: Files >30 days old on NAS
     Method: Sync via rclone
     
  3. Cleanup NAS (after 30 days)
     Trigger: Files successfully in R2 + Drive
     Action: Move to "Archive" folder on NAS (not delete yet)

Manual (Monthly):
  4. Google Drive → External HDD (1st of month)
     Files: All new content from last month
     Method: Manual copy, verify checksums
     Label: "YYYY-MM Backup"
     Storage: Fireproof safe
```

## 💰 FINANCIAL TRACKING

### **Costs**

```yaml
One-Time (Year 1):
  Equipment: $20,000
  Software licenses: $595 (Final Cut, DaVinci)
  Total: $20,595
  
  Depreciation: $4,119/year (5-year straight line)

Monthly Recurring:
  Software: $170/mo
  Storage: $25/mo (R2 + electricity)
  Team (future): $0 → $500/mo (contractors)
  Total: $195-365/mo

Per Video:
  Talent: $0-100 (if guests/actors)
  Location: $0-50 (if renting space)
  Props: $0-50 (as needed)
  Average: $50-200/video
```

### **Revenue Projections**

```yaml
YouTube Ad Revenue (After monetization):
  1K subs, 10K views/mo: $50-150/mo (RPM $5-15)
  10K subs, 100K views/mo: $500-1,500/mo
  100K subs, 1M views/mo: $5,000-15,000/mo

Sponsorships (After 10K subs):
  Dedicated video: $1,000-5,000 (depends on niche)
  Product placement: $500-2,000
  Frequency: 1-2 per month

Affiliate Revenue:
  Tech products: 3-8% commission
  Depends on: Audience size + trust + placement
  Estimate: $100-1,000/mo @ 10K subs

Courses/Digital Products (Future):
  After establishing authority (50K+ subs)
  Revenue potential: $5,000-50,000/mo
```

### **ROI Calculation**

```yaml
Example Video:
  Production cost:
    - Equipment depreciation: $83 (⅟60th of annual)
    - Software: $43 (⅟4th of monthly)
    - Time: 40 hours @ $50/hr = $2,000 (founder time)
    - Outsource: $0 (DIY initially)
    - Props/location: $50
    Total cost: $2,176
  
  Revenue (first 30 days):
    - Ad revenue: $100 (20K views @ $5 RPM)
    - Affiliate: $50 (2 sales)
    Total revenue: $150
  
  ROI: (150 - 2,176) / 2,176 = -93% ❌
  
BUT consider:
  - Video generates revenue forever (long-tail)
  - Subscriber growth (future revenue)
  - Authority building (leads to sponsorships)
  - Skills improvement (faster production over time)
  
By Month 12:
  Same video now:
    - Additional views: 50K (viral or evergreen)
    - Ad revenue: $250 more
    - Affiliate: $200 more (ongoing)
    - Sponsorship: $2,000 (channel brand deal)
    Total revenue: $2,600
  
  ROI: (2,600 - 2,176) / 2,176 = +19% ✅
  
Plus:
  - Gained 500 subscribers from this video
  - LTV of subscriber: $5-50
  - Value created: $2,500-25,000
```
